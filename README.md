## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and cardholders. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses and maintain trust among customers. This project focuses on building a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `creditcard.csv`. It contains transaction data, including features such as transaction amounts and times, and labels indicating whether a transaction is normal or fraudulent.

## Usage

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

1. Download the dataset creditcard.csv and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the code cells step by step to perform the following tasks:
4. Load and explore the dataset
5. Perform data preprocessing
6. Visualize the transaction class distribution
7. Analyze transaction amounts
8. Analyze transaction times
9. Train and evaluate three fraud detection models (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, SVM)
10. Examine the results, including accuracy scores and classification reports for each model.


## Results

Through our analysis and machine learning models, we successfully identified and flagged credit card fraud, contributing to enhanced security measures. Our models demonstrated strong performance in accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, mitigating financial risks associated with fraud.
